# Fabric Workspace
This is a Git repository containing the standard Fabric workspace.  Included are
various Fabric-related projects as submodules, which allows changes to every 
component to be tracked individually, but also for snapshots of the state of all
projects as a single release.

## Getting Started
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:FabricProtocol/workspace.git fabric
```
